Movie recommendation system project P1 done for the course 2DV515 at Linnaeus University. [Link to project description](https://coursepress.lnu.se/courses/web-intelligence/projects/p1)

Start the client and server separately in their respective folders with `npm install` (only has to be run once) followed by `npm start`. Bigger data sets have to be downloaded separately. The JSON dataset can be changed in the file `express-rest/data-utils/dataReader.js`

The recommendation calculation can be modified in the client-gui with different similarity measurements, number of  calculation threads/forks and other recommendation filters.
